These styles are the current styles for (Joel Pittet's Drupal.org)[http://userstyles.org/styles/95179/joel-pittet-s-drupal-org-styles] Styles on userstyles.org

There are a lot of !important's in here... some may not be needed but most are due to how this is applied. I'll try to remove some if they are not needed.
