Drupal.org User Styles
======================

These styles are the styles for [Joel Pittet's Drupal.org](http://userstyles.org/styles/95179/joel-pittet-s-drupal-org-styles) styles on userstyles.org

There are a lot of !important's in there... some may not be needed but most are due to how this is applied. I'll try to remove some if they are not needed.

This is a playground to help clean up what is currently there.
